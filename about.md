I'm a 40-something engineering director at a fairly successful midsize tech company.  I've helped grow it from 10 people to over 2,000 in 8 years.  We had a strong IPO along the way in 2018.  I've stayed on to continue in its success.  I know how to work in small companies.  Learning how to be effective in a large(r) company is something entirely new, and the challenges for leadership are exciting.

I've worked in a few non-profits, including founding a Christian church in the United States.  I helped lead it for 7 years.  I come from a conservative background that I've grown to question deeply as I get older.  This has been caused mainly by the response of the largest protestant 

Topics of interest:

* languages (human and computer),
* ecclesiology (what is a church?),
* epistemology (what is truth?),
* communities,
* transportation,
* aviation,
* travel

I'm also a father of teenagers, ama.
