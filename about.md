title: About Drew!

I'm a 40-something engineering director at a decently successful midsize tech company.  I've helped grow it from 10 people to over 2,000 in 8 years, with an IPO along the way.

Non-professionally, I've worked in a few non-profits, including founding a Christian church in the United States that I helped lead for 7 years.  I come from a conservative background that I've grown to question deeply as I get older.  This site exists in part to explore those questions.

Though I'm immersed in technology, I spend a lot of mental energy in social science.  I'm interested in languages, communities, politics, transportation, race, and everything in between.

I'm also a father of teenagers, ama.
