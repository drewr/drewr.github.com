title: About Drew!
---

I'm a 40-something engineering manager at a decently successful midsize tech company.  I've helped grow a company from 10 people to over 2,000 in 8 years, with an IPO during the seventh year.

Non-professionally, I've worked in a few non-profits, including founding a Christian church in the United States that I helped lead for 7 years.

I'm also a father of teenagers. AMA.
